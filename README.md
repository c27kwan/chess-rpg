* Traditional chess pieces are unbalanced.
In _Chess RPG_, chess pieces have health points (HP), attack and defense.
There are also more chess pieces and a bigger board.
This system helps balance the different types chess pieces and calls for new strategies even for experienced players.
* The game ends when a player's King dies. 
There is no "check" or "checkmate" warnings since Kings don't die on 1 hit.

* When a defending unit survives an attack, the attacking unit is moved to 1 space away from the defending unit.
 The knight is an exception because it is a range unit.
